# IslanderStockPrice
A stock price module
the module was built for really one purpose, to be a method to get three pices of data from the yahoo finance website.
those three pices of data are the price which can be gotten from the class by calling current_price var
second one is the current percantage which can be called from the current_percantage var
the last one is the overal percantage which can be called from the overall_percantage var

for best results i recomend first assigning some instance of the class Prices to a var 
then call the drive() method 
after which you will have the ability call the indevidual variables.

currently when creating an instance of the class you have to provide one argument
the first one is the stock symbole
